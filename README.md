# ShowcaseRepository
This is my small portfolio of various PHP and JS scripts, not very related to each other, but giving an idea of my level of programming skills and program architecture.
# PHP API
These are some examples of simple APIs that receive some data as input, process it and, depending on the situation, write to the database or retrieve data from it.
# One page of my work project
This is literally what the title means, one page from my working draft. It gives the results of an employee's work shift and all logs for that shift. At the moment I haven't rewritten the code so that it can be conveniently executed outside the whole project, but I might do that in the future.
